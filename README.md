* To the left - A section to add new bookmarks
Two input fields and a Button.
Field one is for the title of the bookmark.
Field two is for the URL that the bookmark should link to.
Then submit and you're done!

* To the right - A section for all of the created bookmarks
Each has:
  * The title of the bookmark.
  * The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL).
  * A button to “Mark as Read”.
  * A button to “Remove” the bookmark.

The user should be able to input a title and URL into the appropriate fields.
When the user clicks on the button for creating the bookmark, it should be added to the bookmarks section.

* When the user clicks on the “Mark as Read” button:
A class of .read should be added to the bookmark.
If it already has the class of .read, it should be removed.
When the user clicks on the “Remove” button, the link should be removed from the page.
